# hcloud-operator

Launch and manage VMs and SSH keys in Hetzner Cloud using K8S. 

It acts as a wrapper and state manager for api calls to Hetzner Cloud for managing VMs, SSH keys etc.

The project supports a CRD to launch a VM.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Examples of Custom Resources are in the subfolder config/samples, e.g.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/hcloud_v1alpha1_virtualmachine.yaml
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/hcloud-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/hcloud-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```
